# dotMCLauncher

Yet another Minecraft Launcher core, sucessfully migrated and slightly enhanced. Written in C#.

It makes much easier to work with Minecraft Launcher's things like:

- working with launcher profiles (`dotMCLauncher.Profiling`);
- working with version manifest and version metafiles (`dotMCLauncher.Versioning`);
- working with asset indexes (`dotMCLauncher.Resourcing`);
- working with Yggdrasil authentication requests (`dotMCLauncher.Yggdrasil`).

***Disclaimer**: I do not support making tools for any illegal distributions (games, modificaions, etc.). This core works with files from public sources and with data and files provided by users. Please, respect the job of fellows from Mojang.*

## Requirements

- Not being a dumbass;
- At least **.NET Core 2.1 SDK**.

## To do

- More documentation comments;
- More NUnit tests and fixtures;
- Wiki or another way to provide samples.

## Third-party tools, assemblies and code

- [JSON.NET](http://james.newtonking.com/json);
- [NUnit](https://nunit.org);
- [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/).
